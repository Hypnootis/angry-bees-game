# You've angered some bees, and you are allergic!
This action-packed game is full of bees and running away from those bees. Gather points and discover a huge total of 2 upgrades to help you on your journey to run from those bees for a little bit longer!

This game has been made in a span of around 6 months, working VERY on-and-off. It's not supposed to be a polished AAA game, but rather a showcase of my first game programmed using actual code, all by myself.
